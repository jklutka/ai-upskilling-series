# Example 1: Basic Information Request

This example demonstrates how to structure a basic information request prompt.

## The Prompt

```plaintext
I need information about artificial intelligence. Can you:
1. Define what AI is in simple terms
2. Explain 3 common types of AI
3. Provide 2-3 real-world examples of each type

Please format your response with clear headings and bullet points.
```

## Why This Works

This prompt is effective because it:
1. Clearly states the topic (artificial intelligence)
2. Breaks down the request into specific components
3. Specifies the desired format (headings and bullet points)
4. Sets clear numerical expectations (3 types, 2-3 examples)

## Alternative Approaches

Here are some variations that might be useful in different contexts:

### For a Technical Audience
```plaintext
Provide a technical overview of AI, including:
1. Current definition according to leading academic sources
2. Classification of AI systems (narrow vs general vs super)
3. Technical implementation examples with specific frameworks
Include relevant academic citations where applicable.
```

### For Beginners
```plaintext
Explain AI in the simplest possible terms:
1. What is it? (use everyday analogies)
2. What can it do? (common examples from daily life)
3. What can't it do? (common misconceptions)
Avoid technical terms unless absolutely necessary.
```

## Exercise

Try modifying this prompt to request information about a topic in your field of interest. Remember to:
- Be specific about what information you need
- Structure your request clearly
- Specify your desired format
- Include any relevant context about your audience or purpose
